# Java OOP Concepts

This repository contains examples demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java.

## Concepts Covered

The following concepts are implemented in this repository, each in its own directory:

- **Class and Object**: Basic building blocks of OOP. A class is a blueprint, and an object is an instance.
- **Inheritance**: A mechanism where one class acquires the properties and behaviors of a parent class.
- **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability of an object to take on many forms.
- **Interface**: A reference type in Java used to specify a behavior that classes must implement.
- **Aggregation**: A "has-a" relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent.
- **Association**: A relationship between two separate classes that establishes a connection.
- **Composition**: A strong "has-a" relationship where the child cannot exist without the parent.
- **Constructor Overloading**: Having multiple constructors with different parameter lists.
- **Method Overloading**: Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
- **Method Overriding**: A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class.
- **Dependency Injection**: A design pattern that allows removing hard-coded dependencies and making the application loosely coupled.
- **Final Keyword**: Using the `final` keyword to restrict modification (e.g., constant variables, unextendable classes).
- **Static Members**: Members that belong to the class rather than an instance of the class.
